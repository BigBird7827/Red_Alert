Reports indicate the presence of a small enclave whose physiology matches human DNA with near-perfect precision. Debris scans confirm traces of 23rd-century alloys—evidence that survivors of the lost USS Prospero may have lived among the locals for generations. Starfleet Command has instructed strict adherence to the Prime Directive.",
  "mission_description": "Velara III faces a catastrophic tectonic venting event that could annihilate its largest city. Descendants of a lost Starfleet crew—known to the natives as the 'Sky Born'—have become mythic figures, secretly advancing Velaran society. The Enterprise must decide whether to intervene and expose the Federation’s existence or allow millions to perish in the name of noninterference.",

  "starfleet_message": "Captain’s Log, Stardate 47826.4 — Long-range sensors have detected anomalous warp-harmonic emissions from Velis II, a Class-M world with early fusion-age technology and established orbital platforms. Scans indicate the source is a contained power core now installed in a secured research facility on the northern continent. Analysis shows the device is Romulan in origin — likely wreckage from a scout that crashed twenty-five years ago and was later recovered by surface teams. Velisian engineers have disassembled and reassembled the core into a planetary energy lattice. Their adaptations are unstable; continued operation threatens a catastrophic containment failure capable of destabilizing the atmosphere.",

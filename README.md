# RED ALERT – A Star Trek: LCARS Bridge Simulator

**Red Alert** is a fully interactive, text-based simulation that recreates the atmosphere of commanding a Federation starship during the 24th century. Inspired by the look and feel of *Star Trek: The Next Generation*, it blends narrative decision-making, branching dialogue, and authentic LCARS interface design into a single browser-based experience.

## Overview

Players take the role of a Starfleet commanding officer stationed on the bridge of a starship. Each mission begins with a directive from Starfleet Command and a short briefing. As situations unfold, players make rapid tactical, diplomatic, or scientific decisions that affect the outcome of the mission.
The simulator emphasizes chain-of-command interaction, situational awareness, and moral judgment under pressure. No two runs are exactly alike; each scenario contains multiple branches and outcomes, reflecting the unpredictability of command in deep space.

## Features

- **Authentic LCARS Interface:** Modeled after Starfleet’s 24th-century computer system, complete with color-coded divisions and sleek geometric panels.
- **Dynamic Scenario System:** Storylines are driven by external JSON data, allowing for new missions, variable outcomes, and replayable training exercises.
- **Command Decisions:** Choose from multiple dialogue and tactical options that shape your mission’s success—or failure.
- **Immersive Atmosphere:** Dialogue, alerts, and visual design capture the tone and pacing of classic *Star Trek* bridge operations.
- **Expanding Library:** Future updates will introduce additional missions, departments, and shipboard challenges.

## Objective

The purpose of *Red Alert* is to provide a bridge simulation that feels authentic to Star Trek canon while offering fans a chance to experience the weight of command. It is not a game of winning or losing, but a test of leadership, ethics, and composure in crisis—qualities that define a Starfleet officer.

# 🛑 RED ALERT – A Star Trek: LCARS Bridge Simulator

**Red Alert** is a fully interactive, text-based simulation that recreates the atmosphere of commanding a Federation starship during the 24th century. Inspired by the look and feel of *Star Trek: The Next Generation*, it blends narrative decision-making, branching dialogue, and authentic LCARS interface design into a single browser-based experience.

## 🚀 Overview

Players take the role of a Starfleet commanding officer stationed on the bridge of a starship. Each mission begins with a directive from Starfleet Command and a short briefing. As situations unfold, players make rapid tactical, diplomatic, or scientific decisions that affect the outcome of the mission.

The simulator emphasizes chain-of-command interaction, situational awareness, and moral judgment under pressure. No two runs are exactly alike; each scenario contains multiple branches and outcomes, reflecting the unpredictability of command in deep space.

At the heart of the interface lies **LCARS (Library Computer Access/Retrieval System)** — Starfleet’s adaptive computer framework that governs every starship operation from helm control to environmental regulation. The simulation’s layout, color logic, and workflow emulate LCARS’ minimalist, touch-driven design, creating an environment instantly recognizable to *Star Trek* officers and fans alike.

## 🎯 Objective

The purpose of *Red Alert* is to provide a bridge simulation that feels authentic to Star Trek canon while offering fans a chance to experience the weight of command. It is not a game of winning or losing, but a test of leadership, ethics, and composure in crisis — qualities that define a Starfleet officer.

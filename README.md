# 🛑 RED ALERT – A Star Trek: LCARS Bridge Simulator

**Red Alert** is a fully interactive, text-based simulation that recreates the atmosphere of commanding a Federation starship during the 24th century. Inspired by the look and feel of *Star Trek: The Next Generation*, it blends narrative decision-making, branching dialogue, and authentic LCARS interface design into a single browser-based experience.

## 🚀 Overview

Players take the role of Captain Picard on the bridge of USS Enterprise-D. Each mission begins with a Captain's log, followed by a brief mission objective. As situations unfold, players make rapid tactical, diplomatic, or scientific decisions that affect the outcome of the mission.

The simulator emphasizes chain-of-command interaction, situational awareness, and moral judgment under pressure. There are currently 14 scenarios. Each scenario contains multiple branches and outcomes, reflecting the unpredictability of command in deep space.

At the heart of the interface lies **LCARS (Library Computer Access/Retrieval System)** — Starfleet’s adaptive computer framework that governs every starship operation from helm control to food replication. The simulation’s layout, color logic, and workflow emulate LCARS’ minimalist, touch-driven design, creating an environment instantly recognizable to *Star Trek* officers and fans alike.

## 🎯 Objective

The purpose of *Red Alert* is to provide a bridge simulation that feels authentic to Star Trek canon while offering fans a chance to experience the weight of command. It is not a game of winning or losing, but a test of leadership, ethics, and composure in crisis — qualities that define a Starfleet officer.
